Overview

Performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using SQL.
This was acheived by designing the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and then analyzing the data.

Process

Using the data from the CSV files, first I created the tables for the schema.
